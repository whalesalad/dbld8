Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

<%= @subject %>

We're happy that you joined the family at this early stage!

500 Coins are already yours as a BIG THANK YOU for being an early adopter and 
joining our beta. There are lots of cool features in the pipeline, and surely 
some bugs we haven’t squashed. We’re hoping you’ll go a little easy on us 
while we're taking our baby steps.

In exchange for your patience and any hiccups you might experience along 
the way to our 1.0 launch this summer, we’d like to make it up to you with 
a bunch of extra goodies. Expect lots of extras and sneak peaks at 
new features before anyone else. Come Summer, you'll be all set to rock 
our app in more ways then others!

What is DoubleDate? 

It's all about going out in real-life in a group of four to have fun. 
Grab a friend and create a DoubleDate, or explore what others have 
created nearby. Girls or guys, straight or gay, single or taken... 
it doesn't matter! Instead of browsing profiles and judging others 
on their looks or info, you browse things to do. We've gone back to basics. 
Who knows, you might make some new friends or meet someone special. 
Either way, you'll have a good time with DoubleDate.

What are Wings?

Your Wings are the friends that you go out with, and they're essential
to DoubleDate. We hope that you'll share it with your close friends to pull
them into the fun. 

For every friend you add, we'll give both of you some extra coins.

Whats next?

We’ve worked tremendously hard over the last few months to bring DoubleDate
to life. Our first version is truly great, and we think you’ll really enjoy it. 
However, it’s far from perfect. Don't fear though, we've got a ton in store for you.

Get ready for this summer to be more exciting then ever before!

— Marcus & Michael, Founders of DoubleDate
