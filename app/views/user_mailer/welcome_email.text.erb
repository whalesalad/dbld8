Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

<%= @subject %>

<%= RegistrationEvent::coin_value %> coins are already yours as a big thank you for giving DoubleDate a shot. Coins are used to start incoming chat messages from other users.

DoubleDate is about going out with your wing to meet two other people. A wing can be your best friend, your boyfriend, girlfriend, a colleague from work, your husband or wife, or anyone with a pulse.

Instead of sorting through profiles and surfing through pictures, our mission is to get you out in the real world to have fun. DoubleDate isn't about love and romance, it's about having a great time.

Explore DoubleDates that are nearby in your area. Taking a trip? Filter things that users are doing on the other side of the world.

Have a couple of extra concert tickets? Planning a board game at your local coffee house? Maybe you were invited to a doubles badminton championship? You can post it on DoubleDate!

We've worked really hard to bring DoubleDate to life and we think you'll really enjoy it. We're constantly working on new ways to get you offline and out having fun. Expect some cool things from DoubleDate this summer, we've got a LOT in store for you!

- Marcus & Michael, Founders of DoubleDate
