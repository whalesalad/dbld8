Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

<%= @subject %>

<b><%= RegistrationEvent::coin_value %> Coins are already yours as a BIG THANK
YOU for being one of our first users.

What is it?

DoubleDate is about going out in real-life in a group of four to have fun. Grab
a friend and create a DoubleDate, or explore what others have created nearby.
Girls or guys, straight or gay, single or taken... it doesn't matter. Instead
of browsing profiles and judging others on their looks or info, you browse
things to do. We've gone back to basics. Who knows, you might make some new
friends or meet someone special. Either way, you'll have a good time with
DoubleDate.

What are Wings?

Your Wings are the friends that you go out with, and they're essential to
DoubleDate. We hope that you'll share it with your close friends to pull them
into the fun. For every friend you add, we'll give both of you some extra coins.

Whats next?

We've worked tremendously hard over the last few months to bring DoubleDate to
life. Our first version is truly great, and we think you'll really enjoy it.
Expect some cool things from DoubleDate this summer, we've got a ton in store
for you!

- Marcus & Michael, Founders of DoubleDate
